# Sentence to Emoji Translation
A naive chunking approach to summarizing a sentence to emoji translation using sent2vec and some of emoji2vec's dataset. This is a final senior research project for my undergraduate degree at Clarion University. The paper and explanation of the algorithm can be seen at [TEMPORARY LINK](https://www.authorea.com/users/269084/articles/396929-sentence-to-emoji-translation). 

## Prerequisites
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
- [sent2vec](https://github.com/epfml/sent2vec)
- [spacy]
- [Tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

## Getting off the Ground
All of the Jupyter Notebooks we did our development in are in the obvious folder. Read through those to get an idea of how the algorithm works internally if you want. The python module that we created is in the EmojiTranslation folder.
